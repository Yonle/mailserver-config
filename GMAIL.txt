The Gmail Problem.

You have set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC properly, And these three gives the result of "PASS",
Yet, still marked as spam. How impressive was that?

If you are wondering why Gmail puts any email from your mail server into "Spam" folder,
That's because, It assumes that everything other than "verified" ones are spammers.

Yeah. Zero trust.

So, You basically go to https://gmail.com/postmaster,
Login into your gmail account, Put your email address here,

It will ask you to put a TXT record in your domain root record just to verify the domain.
So, Go put it. The record looked similarly like this:

	google-site-verification=xxxxx-xxxxxx....

And apply it, then press [Verify].

That's basically it.

Then you   w a i t .
Till when? I don't know. Even other Email admins are confused too.

How to make it fast?
Tell Gmail user or send email to your gmail, and [Report as not spam],
And pray Gmail didn't have a beef of your "Dear my babe" mail.
