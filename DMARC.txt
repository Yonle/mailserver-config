DMARC is basically the final verifier after you setup SPF and DKIM.

To put it simply, It does stuff when SPF and DKIM are not valid,
All done to avoid another kind of domain spoofing. (jeez, even DKIM wasn't enough?)

Generally, DMARC wasn't actually needed. Unless necessary, You just put this DNS record
into your domain, Specifically, _dmarc subdomain containing a TXT record that writes:

	v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@waltuh.cyou

and then just apply it, Say, on _dmarc.waltuh.cyou

That's basically it.
